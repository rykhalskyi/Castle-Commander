# Castle Commander - Board Game Development Playground  

I've always had a passion for designing board games, and **Castle Commander** is one of my long-term projects. After spending time refining the concept, I believe now is the perfect moment to bring it to life—digitally! This repository serves as a **playground** where I experiment with mechanics, rules, and game items to make Castle Commander the best it can be.  

Here, I’m developing a **web-based prototype** to test different gameplay elements, balance strategies, and iterate on the core mechanics. Whether it's tweaking unit abilities, adjusting resource systems, or refining turn-based combat, this space allows me to quickly prototype and validate ideas. The goal is to create a fun, strategic, and engaging board game experience—one playtest at a time.  

Feel free to explore the project, try out the latest builds, or even contribute ideas! If you're interested in board game design, strategy mechanics, or just want to follow the development journey, stay tuned for updates. Let’s build the ultimate **Castle Commander** together! 🏰⚔️
